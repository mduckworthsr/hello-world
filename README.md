Michael's Hello World Repository

Hello. Welcome to my hello-world repository.

Date: 12/6/2020

My name is Michael Duckworth Sr and I am an ALB degree candidate at Harvard University's Extension School.

I am finishing the last few assignments in my CSCS E-12 - Fundamentals of Web Development. I am extremely excited about what I have learned in this class and the classes that I will be taking in the future.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my repository.
